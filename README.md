Agri-Market Management System (AMMS)

A web-based agricultural marketplace platform connecting smallholder farmers and buyers through a digital platform. Built with PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.

 Project Overview

AMMS is a comprehensive digital marketplace that:
Enables farmers to list agricultural products and manage orders
Allows buyers to search, browse, and purchase fresh products
Provides administrators with complete system management and analytics
Improves market access and transaction transparency
Supports mobile-friendly interface for accessibility

**Technology Stack**

Backend: PHP (Procedural)
Database: MySQL
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
Server: Apache (XAMPP compatible)
Authentication: PHP Sessions with password hashing
Security: Prepared statements, output sanitization, session verification

**System Requirements**

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Apache Web Server
- XAMPP (or similar LAMP stack)
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

##  Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Extract Project Files

Extract the AMMS project to your XAMPP htdocs directory:
```
C:\xampp\htdocs\amms\


### Step 2: Create Database

1. **Start XAMPP** - Start Apache and MySQL services
2. Open phpMyAdmin:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
   - Login with default credentials (user: root, no password)

3. **Create Database:**
   - Copy all SQL commands from `database/schema.sql`
   - Execute in phpMyAdmin SQL tab
   - OR use the MySQL command line:
   ```sql
   source database/schema.sql
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Database Connection

The database connection is configured in `config/config.php`:
```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_USER', 'root');
define('DB_PASS', '');
define('DB_NAME', 'amms');
```

If your MySQL has a password, update `DB_PASS` value accordingly.

### Step 4: Access the Application

1. Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP
2. Open browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost/amms/
   ```
